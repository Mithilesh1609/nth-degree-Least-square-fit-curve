# nth-degree-Least-square-fit-curve
This is the programming implementation of the **nth degree least squares equation** using Gauss-Jordan Elimination by getting the reduced row echelon form.

I have used **C programming** lanuage to implement this nth degree least square fit curve, it's a **simple linear regression model** to predict the value of weight on the basis of the data of the height and weight of the person.

Here is the sample data is given:
| __Serial NO__ | __Height(cm)__ | __Weight(cm)__ |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 160     | 68      |
| 2         | 155 | 78     |
| 3 | 143 |56 |
| 4 | 162 |70  |
| 5 | 170 |72 | 
| 6 | 175 |78 |
| 7 | 167 |68 |
| 8 | 163 |54 |
| 9 | 156 |43 |
| 10 | 172 |71 |
| 11 | 180 |65 |
| 12 | 159 |59 |
| 13 | 169 |63 |
| 14 | 157 |62 |
| 15 | 161 |90 |
| 16 | 171 |45 |
| 17 | 181 |62 |
| 18 | 177 |57 |
| 19 | 140 |80 |

**Equations**

**W = A*(H^2) + B*(H) + C**
Here A,B,C is constant values.

**Results**

After running the code you will get values of constants are: **A = 0.003703, B = -1.288406, C = 176.578090**
