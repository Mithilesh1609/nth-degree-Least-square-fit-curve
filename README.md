# nth-degree-Least-square-fit-curve
This is the programming implementation of the nth degreeleast squares equation using Gauss-Jordan Elimination by getting the reduced row echelon form.
I have used C programming lanuage to implement this nth degree least square fit curve, it's a simple linear regression model to predict the value of weight on the basis of the data of the height and weight of tbe person.

Here is the sample data is given:
| __Serial NO__ | __Height(cm)__ | __Weight(cm)__ |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 1         | 160     | 68      |
| 2         | 155 | 78     |
| 3 | 143 |56 |
| 4 | 162 |70  |
| 5 | 170 |72 | 
| 6 | 175 |78 |
| 7 | 167 |68 |
| 8 | 163 |54 |
| 9 | 156 |43 |
| 10 | 172 |71 |
| 11 | 180 |65 |
| 12 | 159 |59 |
| 13 | 169 |63 |
| 14 | 157 |62 |
| 15 | 161 |90 |
| 16 | 171 |45 |
| 17 | 181 |62 |
| 18 | 177 |57 |
| 19 | 140 |80 |

**Equations**

W = a*(H^2) + b*(H) + c
Here a,b,c is constant values.

**Results**

After running the code you will get a = 0.003703, b = -1.288406, c = 176.578090
