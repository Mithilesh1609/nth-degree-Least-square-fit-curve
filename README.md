# nth-degree-Least-square-fit-curve
This is the programming implementation of the nth degreeleast squares equation using Gauss-Jordan Elimination by getting the reduced row echelon form.
I have used C programming lanuage to implement this nth degree least square fit curve, it's a simple linear regression model to predict the value of weight on the basis of the data of the height and weight of tbe person.
